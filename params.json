{"name":"toddlerMusicBox","tagline":"A toddler friendly music box.","body":"My toddler is currently one and a half and loves music. My wife and I decided to search for a music playback solution for him. Our first idea was to buy a cd player radio. After my own experience of listening to mp3's for many years I did not want to use CDs anymore. For a short test if let my toddler play with my ipod but he was not able to select his favorite music. Inspired by some other projects I came up with the idea for a custom made music box for him. \r\n\r\n![](images/tmb_003.JPG)\r\n![](images/tmb_005.JPG)\r\n![](images/tmb_006.JPG)\r\n![](images/tmb_004.JPG)\r\n\r\n### Parts list\r\n* my old computer speakers\r\n* [Raspberry Pi Model B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/)\r\n* [EXPLORE-NFC expansion board for Raspberry Pi](http://de.farnell.com/explore-nfc)\r\n* [SparkFun Voltage-Level Translator](https://github.com/sparkfun/TXB0104_breakout)\r\n* 5 [ NeoPixel Diffused 8mm Through-Hole LED](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1734)\r\n* 5 [Arcade LED push buttons](http://stores.ebay.de/arcadier?_trksid=p2047675.l2563)\r\n* MEAN WELL SNT RS 15 5\r\n* MEAN WELL SNT RS 15 12\r\n* NFC Tags\r\n\r\n### Assembly\r\n![](images/tmb_001.JPG)\r\n![](images/tmb_002.JPG)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of guides in the internet how to connect buttons, leds and the nfc board to the Pi i would recommend to search for it.\r\n\r\nI removed the default LED from the arcade buttons and used the Neopixel LED for them. The 8mm version fits perfectly into the buttons.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\nThe Pi is running an [archlinux](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi). I installed Python 2.7 with some extensions and the [Music Player Daemon](http://www.musicpd.org/).\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nIt's a Python based project. I created a modular architecture and some of the system parameters are configurable using a config script. It should be possible to use this code with another count of LED or buttons.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nI was pretty surprised how easy it was for my toddler to put the NFC-cards into the slot. He was able to select the next title and adjust the volume. \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\nI was inspired by the [Song Blocks Project](http://shawnrk.github.io/songblocks/).\r\nThe interface for MPD was inspired by [ncmpy](https://github.com/cykerway/ncmpy).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
